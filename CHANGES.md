# WebRTC System Overhaul - Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes made to fix the WebRTC video/audio calling system.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Configuration Mismatches**
- ✅ RabbitMQ credentials inconsistent between dev and prod
- ✅ TURN credentials not propagated from environment variables
- ✅ Missing EXTERNAL_IP configuration for production deployments
- ✅ Port range limitations not properly documented

### 2. **TURN Server Issues**
- ✅ TURN server not using environment variables for credentials
- ✅ Realm and server name hardcoded instead of dynamic
- ✅ No validation that TURN server process is actually running
- ✅ Missing diagnostic endpoints for troubleshooting

### 3. **Frontend Issues**
- ✅ No proper error handling for TURN config fetching
- ✅ Missing fallback to public STUN servers
- ✅ No logging of ICE candidate types (relay vs srflx vs host)
- ✅ No connection statistics or debugging information

### 4. **Documentation Issues**
- ✅ No troubleshooting guide for WebRTC problems
- ✅ No testing procedures documented
- ✅ Production deployment steps unclear

## Files Modified

### 1. **docker-compose.yml** (Development)
```yaml
Changes:
- Added TURN_USERNAME environment variable

```

### 3. **.env.production**
```env

- Kept TURN credentials consistent across all configs
```

### 4. **stun-turn-service/turnserver.conf**
```conf
Changes:
- Removed hardcoded realm (now set in start.sh from env)
- Removed hardcoded user credentials (now set in start.sh from env)
- Removed hardcoded server-name (now set dynamically)
- Changed max-port from 65535 to 49200 for Docker compatibility
- Simplified configuration to be more dynamic
```

### 5. **stun-turn-service/start.sh**
```bash
Changes:
- Added environment variable reading (TURN_USERNAME, TURN_PASSWORD, TURN_SERVER_HOST, EXTERNAL_IP)
- Dynamic configuration generation at runtime
- Added external-ip configuration based on EXTERNAL_IP env var
- Added process validation (checks if turnserver actually started)
- Better error logging and debugging output
- Uses exec for proper signal handling
```

### 6. **stun-turn-service/server.js**
```javascript
Changes:
- Read TURN credentials from environment variables
- Updated /api/turn/config to use env vars for credentials and host
- Added UDP transport option to ICE servers
- Improved health check to verify turnserver process is running
- Added diagnostic endpoint (/api/turn/diagnostic) with test instructions
- Better logging of configuration on startup
- Added configuration details to health check response
```

### 7. **frontend/src/utils/webrtc-helper.js**
```javascript
Changes:
- Added configuration caching (5 minute cache duration)
- Added request timeout (5 seconds) for TURN config fetch
- Better fallback to public STUN servers on error
- More detailed logging of ICE server configuration
- Added comprehensive WebRTC connection logging
- Added ICE candidate type tracking (host, srflx, relay)
- Added connection statistics logging
- Detects and warns if no TURN relay candidates
- Added iceTransportPolicy, bundlePolicy, rtcpMuxPolicy to config
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios
```

### 2. **WEBRTC_QUICKREF.md**
Quick reference card with:

- Browser console debugging snippets
- Quick fixes for common issues
- Configuration file locations
- Port requirements table
- Monitoring commands

### 3. **test-turn.sh**
Automated test script that:
- Checks if container is running
- Verifies turnserver process is active
- Tests API endpoints
- Checks for errors in logs
- Shows current statistics
- Provides next steps

## Configuration Flow

### Development
```
docker-compose.yml
  ↓
Environment Variables (defaults)
  ↓
start.sh (generates config)
  ↓
/tmp/turnserver.conf (runtime config)
  ↓
turnserver process
  ↓
server.js (exposes API)
```

### Production
```
.env.production
  ↓
docker-compose.prod.yml
  ↓
Environment Variables
  ↓
start.sh (generates config)
  ↓
/tmp/turnserver.conf (runtime config)
  ↓
turnserver process
  ↓
server.js (exposes API)
```

## Testing Procedure

### 1. Quick Test
```bash
./test-turn.sh
```

### 2. Manual Testing
```bash
# Check container
docker ps | grep stun-turn-service

# Check config
curl http://localhost:8005/api/turn/config

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8005/health

# View logs
docker logs stun-turn-service
```

### 3. Browser Testing
Open browser console and paste:
```javascript
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection({
  iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:localhost:3478' },
    { urls: 'turn:localhost:3478', username: 'turnuser', credential: 'turnpassword' }
  ]
});
pc.createDataChannel('test');
pc.onicecandidate = e => e.candidate && console.log('ICE:', e.candidate.type);
pc.createOffer().then(o => pc.setLocalDescription(o));
```

Look for `relay` type candidates - if present, TURN is working!

## Production Deployment Steps

1. **Set environment variables in `.env.production`:**
   ```env
   EXTERNAL_IP=YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_HERE
   TURN_USERNAME=secure_username
   TURN_PASSWORD=secure_password_here
   DOMAIN=your-domain.com
   ```

2. **Open firewall ports:**
   ```bash
   ufw allow 3478/udp
   ufw allow 3478/tcp
   ufw allow 5349/tcp
   ufw allow 49152:49200/udp
   ```

3. **Deploy with production compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Verify deployment:**
   ```bash
   ./test-turn.sh
   ```

5. **Test from remote client:**
   - Access application from different network
   - Start video call
   - Check browser console for "relay" ICE candidates

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Reliability**: Dynamic configuration prevents mismatches
2. **Debuggability**: Comprehensive logging at every level
3. **Testability**: Automated test script and diagnostic endpoints
4. **Documentation**: Complete guides for setup and troubleshooting
5. **Flexibility**: Environment-based configuration for different deployments
6. **Visibility**: Statistics and health checks for monitoring
7. **Resilience**: Fallback mechanisms when TURN server unavailable

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Default values match previous hardcoded values
- Existing deployments will continue working
- New features are additive (diagnostic endpoints, better logging)

## Next Steps for Users

1. Read [WEBRTC_SETUP.md](./WEBRTC_SETUP.md) for complete understanding
2. Use [WEBRTC_QUICKREF.md](./WEBRTC_QUICKREF.md) for daily operations
3. Run `./test-turn.sh` to verify setup
4. For production: Set EXTERNAL_IP and change credentials
5. Monitor `/api/turn/stats` endpoint for connection metrics
