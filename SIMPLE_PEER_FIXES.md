# Simple-Peer WebRTC Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Process Polyfill Error
**Problem:** `Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined`
- Simple-Peer uses Node.js streams that expect `process` and `Buffer` globals
- These don't exist in browser environment

**Solution:** Added polyfills in `index.js`
```javascript
import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
window.Buffer = Buffer;
window.process = window.process || { env: {} };
```

### 2. âœ… Signal Handling Logic
**Problem:** "Received signal but no peer exists" errors
- Signals were being received before peer was created
- Offer signals needed special handling

**Solution:** Updated `handleSignal` to:
- Store offers as incoming calls
- Only signal existing peers
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### 3. âœ… Call Accept Flow
**Problem:** Peer not receiving the initial offer when accepting
- Callee wasn't signaling the stored offer to their peer

**Solution:** In `acceptCall()`:
```javascript
// After creating peer
peer.signal(callData.signal); // Signal the incoming offer
```

### 4. âœ… Event Handler Cleanup  
**Problem:** Duplicate event handlers
- Both `call-offer` and `webrtc-signal` were handling offers

**Solution:** Removed `call-offer` listener
- Only use `webrtc-signal` for all signaling
- Cleaner, simpler flow

## Current Flow

### Caller Side
1. User clicks "Call" button
2. `startCall()` gets media and creates peer (initiator=true)
3. Peer emits 'signal' event with offer
4. Offer sent to backend via `webrtc-signal`
5. Backend forwards to callee
6. Peer receives answer via `webrtc-signal`
7. Connection established

### Callee Side
1. Receives `webrtc-signal` with offer
2. `handleSignal()` stores it as incoming call
3. User clicks "Accept"
4. `acceptCall()` gets media and creates peer (initiator=false)
5. Peer is signaled with the stored offer
6. Peer emits 'signal' event with answer
7. Answer sent to backend via `webrtc-signal`
8. Backend forwards to caller
9. Connection established

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `frontend/src/index.js`
   - Added Buffer and process polyfills

2. âœ… `frontend/src/hooks/useWebRTC_simple_peer.js`
   - Fixed `handleSignal` logic
   - Fixed `acceptCall` to signal incoming offer
   - Updated `handleCallOffer` to include signal

3. âœ… `frontend/src/App.js`
   - Removed `call-offer` event listener
   - Updated dependencies array

## Testing

To test the video call:

1. Open app in two browser tabs
2. Login as different users
3. Click video call icon next to online user
4. Accept the call in other tab
5. Video/audio should connect

## Debug Logging

Check console for:
- âœ… `=== STARTING CALL ===`
- âœ… `[Caller] Sending signal: offer`
- âœ… `Received signal from: <user> Type: offer`
- âœ… `=== ACCEPTING CALL ===`
- âœ… `Signaling incoming offer to peer`
- âœ… `[Callee] Sending signal: answer`
- âœ… `Received remote stream`
- âœ… `Peer connected!`

## Common Issues

### Still getting process error?
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Restart dev server

### No video/audio?
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure HTTPS (required for getUserMedia)
- Check camera/mic not in use

### Connection fails?
- Check console for errors
- Verify both users connected to WebSocket
- Check STUN/TURN server accessibility

## Next Steps

If everything works:
- ðŸŽ‰ Video calls are now functional!
- Consider adding call quality indicators
- Add screen sharing feature
- Add recording capability

If issues persist:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify WebSocket connection is stable
- Test with different browsers
- Check network/firewall settings
